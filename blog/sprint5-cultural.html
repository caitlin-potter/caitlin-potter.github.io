                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your
                            ego as a result of the core learning?</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        At this stage of my learning, when I come across a problem that I find challenging, I often
                        revert back to having a fixed mindset, and the fear of failure kicks in.
                        I need to remind myself that I am capable of learning new things and need to continue to try
                        harder to have a growth mindest.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The second thing that I learned was that I often feel like a burden when having to ask peers and
                        teachers for help. This is something that I need to be more comfortable doing moving in to
                        bootcamp
                        as, ultimately I want to be able to learn and collaborate with my cohort as much as I possibly
                        can.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lastly, I found it quite difficult to focus if I found the challenges too difficult. I came up
                        against so many blocks and then struggled to break down what felt like a huge problem in to
                        smaller ones.
                        I have a lot to practise when it comes to changing my brain to think like a programmer.

                    </p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning
                            and programming?</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        Values, empathy and self awareness are important in learning and programming because programming
                        involves a lot of team work and collaboration with diverse groups.
                        Values are important as they are the essential building blocks of teambuilding and programming
                        involves a lot of teamwork. Empathy is super important in learning and team environments
                        because everyone learns differently. Being more empathetic creates a more comfortable learning
                        environment for everyone. Self-awareness is also very important as it ultimately increases
                        productivity.
                        The more people become aware of their mindset and behaviour, the more they can avoid creating
                        harmful behaviour and work well in a team environment.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong>
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I think I was most surprised by the fact that you can learn more effectively by changing the way
                        you think. I found it really interesting to learn about a fixed mindset versus a growth mindset.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core
                            learning?</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        The most challenging part of the core learning for me was creating personal blog posts and
                        knowing that other people would be reading them.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
                            focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        The core skills we learn will help us become more employable when trying to get a job in the
                        tech sector. Being able to work well in a team is really important in becoming a successful
                        programmer and being successful in any team environment.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
                            waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?
                            Justify your answer.</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        I don't think it was a waste of time at all. I think it is really important to reflect on what
                        I've learned and also ways for me to try and improve my learning. I definitely do need a lot
                        more time to practice
                        programming, but I think the core learning has been a helpful reminder to get me to reflect
                        daily and in some ways was a nice break away from being stuck on problems.
