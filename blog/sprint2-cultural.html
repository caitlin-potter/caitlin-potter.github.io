                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
                            Bootcamp?</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        I hope that a strength of mine during bootcamp will be that I can collaborate well with others
                        in my cohort.
                        In terms of my weaknesses I think that I will struggle to speak up when it comes to group
                        situations. I often struggle to communicate and explain things in a clear way,
                        especially if it is a concept that I don't fully understand. Presenting is also not a strong
                        point of mine, so having to practice this will help build up my confidence.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
                            will be?</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        I think my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be not to take things too personally
                        and to not always compare my learning to others.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        I expect to learn in a friendly environment as well as be pushed out of my comfort zone daily. I
                        also expect to receive feedback on the work I am doing.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        While on bootcamp I will try and put in as much effort as I can. If I don't understand something
                        I will try to put more time in to it outside of Bootcamp hours until I have a better
                        understanding.
                        I want to make sure that I enjoy my time on Bootcamp as well. I need to remember that it is such
                        a short course and that I need to make the most of the experience.

                    <h3 class="blog-title2"><strong>Foundations</strong></h3>
                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</strong></h3>
                    <p>My medium term goal is to change career paths and move in to tech, by becoming a web developer.
                        I would love to be in a career that I enjoy and also in a working environment where I can
                        continue to grow and develop my skills, but have have fun at the same time.
                        I do enjoy working in areas that involve public and community health, so ultimately I would like
                        to combine my new web development skills with a role that is helping out the community in terms
                        of health in some way.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>What skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at
                            EDA?</strong></h3>
                    <p>Firstly, I would like to learn the technical skills well enough to move in to, and do well, in a
                        web development role.
                        The main human skills I would like to develop are to improve my communication skills (especially
                        when working in teams) and also to learn how to give and receive feedback well.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations</strong></h3>
                    <p>In terms of my strengths, I believe I am supportive, reliable and patient, which helps me work
                        well in teams.
                        Although these strengths often help me work in teams, I often take things too personally,
                        internalise my feelings and struggle to ask for help, which lead me to stand back in group
                        situations.</p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>How will you manage your workload in this programme?</strong></h3>
                    <p>I will manage my workload during foundations by working from the EDA space as often as I can, and
                        by making sure I set goals, plan my day well and most importantly take breaks when I need to.
                        If I don't set goals for the day, I struggle to stay focused and keep on track.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>How and where will you seek help in a timely way?</strong></h3>
                    <p>I will do my best to figure out how to solve a problem myself first. Although it is important for
                        me to figure things out myself first,
                        I've realised that I do struggle to ask for help, as I want to be able to figure things out for
                        myself. This isn't always effective as it means that I sit there struggling for longer,
                        ultimately wasting time, when I should just reach out to my peers. I need to keep reminding
                        myself that we are all on a learning journey together, and it's fine if it takes me longer than
                        others. </p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>What do you expect from the facilitation team?</strong></h3>
                    <p>I expect support and guidance from the facilitation team where necessary, so I know if I am on
                        the right track. The team has been great so far, and have already provided me with support and
                        guidance.
                        I would also appreciate any feedback that will help me grow both my technical and human skills.
