        <h1>Identities, Values & Strengths</h1>
        <h3><em>10 September 2019</em></h3>

        <div>
            <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
            <p>When trying to think of an example for this exercise, I could only think of really heavy or personal examples. An extended family member suggested making up an example,
            which would ultimately go against being honest, and this is a core value of mine. Yes, this probably would have given me a good example to go on my blog, but wouldn't have been worth feeling guilty over. 
            Using a personal example would have been very challenging for me to do as these examples involved me talking about things that others have shared with me in confidence. Sharing one of those examples would
            have challenged these values of mine: trust, loyalty and kindness towards the others involved. Using this situation and turning it in to an example that I could use was a more light-hearted way to show my personal
            values when trying to make an ethical decision.   
            </p>

            <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
            <p>I am from a hard-working and supportive family. My parents have always been very reliable and hard-working. Honesty was definitely a value that was drilled in to my siblings and I throughout our childhood. 
            I believe that these values have come from my parents and grandparents, and I have seen these values used in my siblings growing families too.</p>

            <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development. Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
            <p>In terms of my strenghs, I believe that I am supportive, reliable and patient. In terms of my learning and career development, these have enabled me to be a supportive team member. I try to be as hard-working as I can,
            and in terms of reliability, I'll do my best to complete tasks when they are expected to be completed. 
            </p>
    
            <p>In terms of my weaknesses, I tend to take things too personally and often internalise my feelings. I do find it difficult to ask for help when I am struggling as I do not want to burden others. Although being supportive is a strength of mine,
             it is also a weakness as am often willing to let things slide, or believe things will eventually improve.</p>

            <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
            <p>The example that I am thinking of involves tension with with a work colleague, which not only affected me but other members of my team. This was due to lack of communication and deeper personal issues. I was trying to work as productively and learn as much I could to grow and develop, 
            and in order to do so I learnt to bypass that work colleague and seek others help more than I possibly should have. Other strategies that I used involved sending out reminders and trying to be as organised and structured as possible. 
            This included making sure there was a paper trail to help support myself. I think these strategies were somewhat effective at the time as they helped me complete my work and learn as much as I could to grow.
            Reflecting back on this, other strategies that I would try would involve better communication, as I ended up bypassing this work colleague and they were often unaware of the work that I was doing at the time. Ensuring that there is as much transparency as possible in the team would hopefully improve productivity.</p>
