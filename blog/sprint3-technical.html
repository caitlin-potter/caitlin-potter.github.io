                        <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS.</strong></h3>
                        <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</p> 

                        <p>HTML acts as the builder and dictates the content and structure of a webpage, while CSS acts as the interior designer by modifying the design and display of the HTML elements.
                        The interior designer (CSS), wouldn't be able to do their job and decorate the home without the builder (HTML) having created the space to design. HTML can function without CSS, however, it wouldn't make for a very exciting home (or webpage in this case).</p>
    
                        <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</strong></h3>
                        <p>Control flow statements are used to determine which section of code should be run in a program at any time. 
                        Control flow can be adjusted by using these control flow statements to conditionally execute statements, to repeatedly execute a block of statements, and to otherwise change the normal flow order of control.
                        Deciding whether or not to run some code depending on if a condition is true and deciding to run some code repeatedly while a condition is true are important when writing code.</p>
    
                        <p>The if/else control flow statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed.
                        An example of an if/else statement is when making a bed. If the bottom sheet is on first then you can continue making the rest of the bed. Otherwise you need to put the fitted sheet on first.</p>
                        
                        <p>Loops are a sequence of instructions that are continually repeated until a certain condition is met. An example of this is doing your washing. 
                        You wash your clothes until they are clean, hang them out to dry, fold them and put them away. The condition of clean folded clothes has been met, so the sequence of instructions will end.</p>
 

                        <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</strong></h3>
                        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is the way that JavaScript interacts with the content within a website. 
                        The DOM is an important piece of functionality that is used for working with HTML documents, as it ties HTML and CSS with JavaScript. In graphical form it looks like a tree of elements or nodes, 
                        which can be things like: elements, attributes, text content, comments, and document-related items. JavaSript can be used to read or change the DOM. Any change you make to the DOM through JavaScript is reflected in what gets shown in the browser.</p> 

                        <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</strong></h3>
                        <p>An array is used to store a collection of data, however, it can be more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
                        When accessing the data from an array you index the array name, which is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. E.g <strong>int var = number[0];</strong></p>

                        <P>An object is created by using curly brackets <strong>{ }</strong> with a list of properties. A property of an object can be described as a variable that is attached to the object, which can be defined by assigning it a value.
                        You can access a particular property by using dot notation (e.g, <strong>objectName.propertyName</strong>) or square brackets (e.g, <strong>objectName['propertyName']</strong>). 
                        It is important to remember, that if the property has a space in its name you need to make sure that you use bracket notation, rather than dot notation.</P>  

                        <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</strong></h3>
                        <p>A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task. By giving the function a name and defining parameters it should accept, you can pass information to the function and return some result.  
                        Functions are useful because they are re-usable, which means once a function is defined, it can be used over and over again and you can call it anywhere else in your program, which will ultimately save you work.</p>
