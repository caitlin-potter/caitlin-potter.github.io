                        <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</p> 

                        <p>HTML acts as the builder and dictates the content and structure of a webpage, while CSS acts as the interior designer by modifying the design and display of the HTML elements.
                        The interior designer (CSS), wouldn't be able to do their job and decorate the home without the builder (HTML) having created the space to design. HTML can function without CSS, however, it wouldn't make for a very exciting home (or webpage in this case).</p>

                        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is the way that JavaScript interacts with the content within a website. 
                        The DOM is an important piece of functionality that is used for working with HTML documents, as it ties HTML and CSS with JavaScript. In graphical form it looks like a tree of elements or nodes, 
                        which can be things like: elements, attributes, text content, comments, and document-related items. JavaSript can be used to read or change the DOM. Any change you make to the DOM through JavaScript is reflected in what gets shown in the browser.</p>
