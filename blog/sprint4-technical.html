                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>Examples of Problems</strong></h3>
                    <p>I encountered a problem rather early on, when trying to work through the fizzbuzz kata. For this kata I didn't even know where to begin,
                    or what to even attempt to look up to help me begin. I ended up asking for my facilitator's help quite a lot throughout this kata and
                    still struggled with the concept. I felt worried about having to ask for help so early on, as well as being frustrated with myself for having
                    to keep asking for help as I couldn't grasp the concept. I learnt that ultimately it's fine to ask for help, but that I do need to try a number of
                    different approaches out for myself before I check in with my facilitator. I also learnt that I need to go back over the basics of JavaScript
                    before bootcamp in order to solidify JavaScript methods. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Throughout sprint 4 kata challenges, I'm not sure I solved any of the problems elegantly. Although, I did surprise myself on the fourth and fifth kata challenge
                    as I managed to pass some tests on my own before having to ask for help. This was quite a relief following the fizzbuzz kata challenge and helped me build up some confidence
                    with how to approach problems moving forward. The problem solving techniques that I used for these challenges were: googling, console.logging, trying something and
                    asking for help when I couldn't move forward. I felt less frustrated with myself for these challenges and more comfortable asking for help. 
                    I learnt that I've still got a lot more to learn before I feel comfortable solving problems using JavaScript methods.  
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>Problem Solving Techniques</strong></h3>
                    <p><strong>Pseudocode: </strong>This is a problem solving technique that I haven't really used before, but am interested in using moving forward as
                    I think it will be beneficial to use when trying to break down a problem.</p>

                    <p><strong>Trying something: </strong>I have no issue approaching a problem by trying something. Although, at the moment this technique doesn't actually work well 
                    for me as I don't know what to try.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rubber ducky method: </strong>I'm keen to start using this method, especially because I have trouble articulating why I am using certain functions.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Reading error messages: </strong>At the moment I don't feel that confident reading the error messages. I think I have been avoiding reading them properly
                    as I haven't been able to interpret their meaning most of the time.</p>

                    <p><strong>Console.logging: </strong>I'm starting to feel more confident console.logging. I find console.logging helpful as it is good to check what your code is doing at each step.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Googling: </strong>I have been googling everthing up to this point. It is the first thing that I do to help me even attempt to start solving
                    a problem.</p>

                    <p><strong>Asking your peers for help: </strong>I find it quite difficult to ask my peers for help fully. I'll let them know that I'm struggling,
                    but just continue to struggle for a while on my own. I'll get better as I become more comfortable with people on my cohort.</p>

                    <p><strong>Asking coaches for help: </strong>I think I feel more comfortable asking my facilitator for help over my peers. Although I did struggle to ask
                    for help inititally, I'm now possibly asking for too much help.</p>

                    <p><strong>Improving your process with reflection: </strong>I think this technique is really useful and I feel quite confident with being able to reflect on
                    my learning. I do think I need to reflect more on what I learn in regards to my technical learning.</p>
