                        <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</strong></h3>
                        <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people as it helps people to understand that intelligence is malleable and that if they put the effort in to learn that they can also achieve.
                        Judy Willis (neurologist and educator), found her students to be more motivated to study when they knew that they were all fully physically capable of building knowledge and changing their brains.</p> 
                        
                        <p>Having a growth mindset over a fixed mindset is more powerful in achieving success and happiness, as realising that your brain is constantly changing is important in continuing to learn.</p>

                        <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</strong></h3>
                        <p>I might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for my own benefit by making sure I practice and reflect on the things I’ve learnt to make that information more permanent in my brain. 
                        I will try and put these new learnings in to context and remember that the brain is malleable and constantly changing.</p>

                        <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>Discuss what the growth mindset is and why it is relevant</strong></h3>
                        <p>Having a growth mindset means relishing opportunities for self-improvement. Anyone can be good at anything because your abilities are entirely due to your actions. 
                        This is relevant as I am going through the foundations course in preparation for bootcamp and by developing a growth mindset I will be able to learn better and more.</p>

                        <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</strong></h3>
                        <p>I will integrate a growth mindset in to my learning journey by putting more effort in to being positive about what I’m learning. 
                        I will work on keeping my outlook positive and replace the word failing with the word learning. 
                        I need to remember that it is important to learn from your mistakes and to value the process over the product. </p>  

                        <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy</strong></h3>
                        <p>These understandings will influence my learning plan and strategy as ultimately I do have a lot to learn in a short space of time and I need to make sure that I remember that reverting back to a fixed mindset will not help me learn and continue to grow and develop. 
                        Understanding that I need to have a growth mindset, put the time in to practice and put in a lot of effort is important.</p>
