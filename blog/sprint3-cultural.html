                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong></h3>
                    <p>Emotional intelligence (or Emotional Quotent - EQ) is defined as the ability to recognise, understand and manage our own emotions,
                    as well as to recognise, understand and influence the emotions of others. This means being aware that emotions can power how we behave
                    and that they can also impact others in both positive and negative ways. It means learning how to manage both our own and other's emotions
                    in times that we are stressed or under pressure.</p>

                    <p>Emotional intelligence has been found to include at least three skills: emotional awareness, or the ability to identify and name your own emotions;
                    the ability to control those emotions and apply them to tasks like thinking and problem solving; and the ability to manage emotions,
                    which includes both regulating your own emotions and helping others to do the same.</p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>How is it different to IQ?</strong></h3>
                    <p>Emotional intelligence refers to how a person understands their own emotions along with other's emotions, whereas, IQ stands for Intelligence Quotient
                    and shows a person's intelligence level.</p>

                    <p>A person with good emotional intelligence can recognise, control and express their own emotion’s and assess other’s emotions.
                    Whereas, a person with a high IQ can learn, understand and implement knowledge, and possesses logical reasoning and abstract thinking.</p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title3"><strong>Why is it important?</strong></h3>
                    <p>Emotional intelligence is important as it can help us in a number of ways: from helping us look after our physical and mental health through to our ability to inspire and lead others.
                    It's important when it comes to managing relationships effectively and also when it comes to conflict resolutions. 
                    Your work life can be largely affected by your emotional intelligence and it enables you to build and drive successful teams.</p>
