            <h3 class="blog-title3"><em>14 September 2019</em></h3>

            <p><strong>Classes</strong> and <strong>IDs</strong> are selectors and act as hooks so that you can assign HTML elements to them to make them more specific. 
            They are very important and we rely on them every day to do the styling and page manipulation that we need to do.</p>

            <p>ID's are <strong>unique.</strong> Each element can only have one ID and each page can only have one element with that ID. This is important to remember as your code will
            will not pass validation if you use the same ID on more than one element.</p>

            <p>Classes are <strong>not</strong> unique. You can use the same class on multiple elements, and you can use multiple classes on the same element.</p>

            <p>In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a <strong>full stop (“.”)</strong> and an ID selector is a name preceded by a <strong>hash character (“#”).</strong></p>
